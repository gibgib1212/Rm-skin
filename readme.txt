(Last updated:03/26/2024)
-------------------------------------

Thank you very much for downloading "Rm-skin".
This skin is a simple dark skin in "R-skin" format.
To use the Rm-skin folder, place the Rm-skin-main folder as shown below.
"beatorajaX.X.X/skin/Rm-skin..." (or "beatorajaX.X.X/skin/Rm-skin-main...")

Also, as a reminder, the initial transparency values for some items are set to "0".
I apologize for the inconvenience, but in the "beatoraja X.X.X configuration" skin tab,
please enter any value for "a" in the field labeled "Transparence".
Please see the included "User's manual.pdf" for details.

In addition, I assume no responsibility for any malfunction of equipment, facilities, etc. 
caused by the use of this skin.
