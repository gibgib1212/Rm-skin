"Rm-skin"
Full HD (1920x1080) Playskin for beatoraja
(Last updated:07/06/2023)
-------------------------------------

Thank you very much for downloading "Rm-skin".
This skin is a simple dark skin in "R-skin" format.
To use the Rm-skin folder, place the Rm-skin-main folder as shown below.
beatorajaX.X.X/skin/Rm-skin-main...

Also, as a reminder, the initial transparency values for some items are set to "0".
I apologize for the inconvenience, but in the "beatoraja X.X.X configuration" skin tab,
please enter any value for "a" in the field labeled "Transparence".
Please see the included NOTICE.png for details.

In addition, I created this skin without any specialized knowledge of the Lua language.
This is not limited to the Lua language, but there is a possibility of fatal defects such as 
memory leaks when writing skins using a programming language as opposed to the csv format.
I have debugged the skin and have made every effort to simplify the coding 
so that it will not cause any problems, but I will not be held responsible for 
any malfunctions of equipment or facilities that may occur as a result of using this skin.

-------------------------------------

In creating this skin, I have used code descriptions and images from other authors.
I would like to express our gratitude to each of them and their products as follows.

Dear 4228, "Rogan".
	The source code for this skin is based on 4228's Rogan's Play skin.
	I had no idea how to write in Lua at the beginning, but 4228's simple and highly 
	readable code was a guide for me in the process of creating the code. 
	Thank you very much.

Dear むにむにおじさん, "m-select".
	Most of the materials in my skin are borrowed from and processed by m-select.
	If むにむにおじさん had not given us permission to modify and distribute the images, 
	this skin would never have been created. Thank you very much.

Dear KASAKO, "Modern_Chic".
	Five of the six bombs in this skin are modified from 
	clear ring_blue SCUROed" by Modern_Chic.
	Thank you very much for publishing these high-quality bombs.

Dear Retsukiya, "R-skin".
	I'm using R-skin combo images (2 types) for this skin.
	R-skin is a very well-known skin in the o!m community, 
	and various people have created variants of R-skin.
	Not to use that as an excuse, but our skin also borrows combo images 
	without permission.
	If you have any problems, please contact me.
	I will take measures such as replacing the combo image as soon as possible.

Producer unknown.
	We also borrow judgm image widely circulated in the o!m community without permission.
	Please contact me if you have any problems with this as well.

-------------------------------------

This skin uses "RictyDiminished-Bold" and "RictyDiminished-Regilar" fonts.

-------------------------------------

As stated above, this skin was created by re-editing an image 
that is the copyrighted work of others.　Therefore, modification or redistribution 
of this skin is prohibited.
However, I would like you to modify and redistribute only the ".lua file" of this skin.
I would be more than happy if more people are interested in making skins and 
if the beatoraja community becomes more lively.
I can't deny that there is still a lack of information on how to write lua files on beatoraja.
So, if you are ever stuck on editing a lua file, I may be able to help you in some small way,
Please contact me and i will do my best to respond.

-------------------------------------

As for the future of this skin, i cannot say that it is completely clean-handed in that 
it uses Retsukiya's combo image and Stepmania's judge's image without permission.
So I would like to replace the combo and judge with a copyright clean one, 
but I have no knowledge of image manipulation or design, so if there is anyone who can produce images like the above and give me permission to use them as part of this skin, I would 
appreciate it if you would contact me.
